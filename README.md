### Project Overview
The data was scraped using the GitHub API, gathering user profiles and repositories with a specific location filter for Basel, using pagination to ensure all entries were included.

A surprising fact is that hireable users, on average, follow significantly more people than non-hireable users.

Developers should enable both project and wiki features in repositories to encourage better documentation and collaboration.
