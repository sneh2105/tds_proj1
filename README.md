### Project Overview
This project scrapes GitHub users in Basel with over 10 followers and their repositories.

- Data was scraped using GitHub’s REST API with Python’s `requests` library and stored securely using environment variables.
- The most surprising finding was that many repositories lack a defined license, possibly limiting contributions.
- Developers should add project licenses and enable wikis to foster collaboration.

Additional analyses and insights are provided in the code.
